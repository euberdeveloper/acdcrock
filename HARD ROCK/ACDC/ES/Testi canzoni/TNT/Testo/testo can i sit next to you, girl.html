		<div>I met this girl for the first time

	              <br> on Saturday night
		 
		<br> Standing in the queue at the Odeon alright
		 
		<br> Oh I took her by surprise
		 
		<br> When I gave her one of my lines
		 
		<br> She started smiling at me real fine (ha ha)
		 
		<br> That’s when I said
		 
		<br>
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you?
		 
		<br>
		 
		<br> At intermission we were doing alright
		 
		<br> Until this guy came up
		
		<br> and stood by her side
		 
		<br> Oh I took him by surprise
		 
		<br> When I gave him one of my lines
		 
		<br> She started smiling at me real fine
		 
		<br> And that’s when I said
		 
		<br>
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you
		 
		<br> Yeah, c’mon now!
		 
		<br> So let me!
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
		 
		<br> C’mon!
		 
		<br> Can I sit next to you, girl
