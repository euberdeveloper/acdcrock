			<div>In the beginning<br />
Back in nineteen fifty-five<br />
Man didn�t know<br />
about a rock �n� roll show<br />
And all that jive<br />
The white man had the smoltz<br />
The black man had the blues<br />
No one knew what they was gonna do<br />
But Tchaikovsky had the news<br />
He said<br />
<br />�Let there be sound�, and there was sound<br />
�Let there be light�, and there was light<br />
�Let there be drums�, and there was drums<br />
�Let there be guitar�, and there was guitar<br />
�Let there be rock�<br />
<br />And it came to pass<br />
That rock �n� roll was born<br />
All across the land every rockin� band<br />
Was blowing up a storm<br />
The guitarman got famous<br />
The businessman got rich<br />
And in every bar there was a<br />
super star with a seven year itch<br />
There were fifteen million fingers<br />
Learning how to play<br />
And you could hear the fingers picking<br />
And this is what they had to say<br />
<br />�Let there be light�<br />
�Sound�<br />
�Drums�<br />
�Guitar�<br />
�Let there be rock�<br />
<br />One night in a club called<br />
`The Shaking Hand�<br />
There was a ninety-two<br />
decibel rocking band<br />
The music was good<br />
and the music was loud<br />
And the singer turned<br />
and he said to the crowd<br />
<br />�Let there be rock�</div>
