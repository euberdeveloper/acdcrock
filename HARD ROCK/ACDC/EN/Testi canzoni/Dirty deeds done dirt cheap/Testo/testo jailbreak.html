			<div>There was a friend of mine on murder<br />
And the judge&#8217;s gavel fell<br />
Jury found him guilty<br />
Gave him sixteen years in hell<br />
He said &#8220;I ain&#8217;t spending my life here<br />
I ain&#8217;t living alone<br />
Ain&#8217;t breaking no rocks on the chain gang<br />
I&#8217;m breakin&#8217; out and headin&#8217; home&#8221;<br />
<br />Gonna make a jailbreak<br />
And I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; towards the sky<br />
I&#8217;m gonna make a jailbreak<br />
Oh, how I wish that I could fly<br />
<br />All in the name of liberty<br />
All in the name of liberty<br />
Got to be free<br />
<br />Jailbreak, let me out of here<br />
Jailbreak, sixteen years ah<br />
Jailbreak, had more<br />
than I can take<br />
Jailbreak, yeah<br />
<br />He said he&#8217;d seen his lady<br />
being fooled with<br />
By another man<br />
She was down and he was up<br />
Had a gun in his hand<br />
Bullets started flying everywhere<br />
And people started to scream<br />
Big man lying on the ground<br />
With a hole in his body<br />
Where his life had been<br />
<br />But it was all in the name of liberty<br />
All in the name of liberty<br />
I got to be free<br />
<br />Jailbreak, jailbreak<br />
I got to break out<br />
Out of here<br />
<br />Heartbeats, they were racin&#8217;<br />
Freedom, he was chasin&#8217;<br />
Spotlights, sirens, rifles firing<br />
But he made it out<br />
With a bullet in his back<br />
<br />Jailbreak, jailbreak<br />
Jailbreak, jailbreak<br />
Jailbreak, jailbreak<br />
Jailbreak, jailbreak<br />
Jailbreak, jailbreak</div>
