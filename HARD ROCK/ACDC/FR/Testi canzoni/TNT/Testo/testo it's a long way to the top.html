			<div>
			<br>
	 	
			<br>Ridin' down the highway, goin' to a show
		<br> Stop in all the by-ways, playin' rock'n'roll
		<br> Gettin' robbed, gettin' stoned
		<br> Gettin' beat up, broken boned
		<br> Gettin' had, gettin' took
		<br> I tell you folks, it's harder than it looks!
		<br>
		<br> It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock'n'roll
		<br> It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock'n'roll
		<br> If you think it's easy doin' one night stands
		<br> Try playin' in a rock’n’roll band
		<br> It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock'n'roll
		<br>
		<br> Hotel, motel, make you wanna cry
		<br> Lady do the hard sell, know the reason why
		<br> Gettin' old, gettin' grey
		<br> Gettin' ripped off, under-paid
		<br> Gettin' sold, second hand
		<br> That's how it goes playin' in a band
		<br>
		<br> It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock'n'roll
		<br> It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock'n'roll
		<br> If you wanna be a star of stage and screen, look out, it's rough and mean
		<br> It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock'n'roll</div>
