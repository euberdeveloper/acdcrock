			<div>I'm a rolling thunder, a pouring rain
			<br/>I'm comin' on like a hurricane
			<br/>My lightning's flashing across the sky 
			<br/>You're only young but you're gonna die
			<br/>
			<br/>I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
			<br/>Nobody's putting up a fight
			<br/>I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
			<br/>I'm gonna get you, Satan get you
			<br/>
			<br/>CHORUS:
			<br/>Hell's Bells
			<br/>Yeah, Hell's Bells
			<br/>You got me ringing Hell's Bells
			<br/>My temperature's high, Hell's Bells
			<br/>
			<br/>I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine 
			<br/>If you're into evil you're a friend of mine
			<br/>See my white light flashing as I split the night
			<br/>'Cause if good's on the left, then I'm stickin' to the right
			<br/>
			<br/>I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
			<br/>Nobody's puttin' up a fight
			<br/>I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
			<br/>I'm gonna get you, Satan get you
			<br/>
			<br/>CHORUS
			<br/>
			<br/>yeow
			<br/>Hell's Bells, Satan's comin' to you
			<br/>Hell's Bells, he's ringing them now
			<br/>Hell's Bells, the temperature's high
			<br/>Hell's Bells, across the sky
			<br/>Hell's Bells, they're takin' you down
			<br/>Hell's Bells, they're draggin' you around
			<br/>Hell's Bells, gonna split the night
			<br/>Hell's Bells, there's no way to fight, yeah
			<br/>
			<br/>Ow, ow, ow, ow
			<br/>
			<br/>Hell's Bells</div>
