			<div>Idle juvenile on the street, on the street<br>Who is kicking everything with his feet, with his feet<br>Fighting on the wrong side of the law, of the law<br>Don't kick, don't fight, don't sleep at night<br>It's shake a leg, shake a leg, shake a leg, shake it yeah<br><br>Keeping out of trouble with eyes in the back of my face<br>Kicking ass in the class and they tell me you're a damn disgrace<br>They tell me what they think but they stink and I really don't care<br>Got a mind of my own, move on, get out of my hair<br><br>Chorus:<br>Shake a leg, shake your head<br>Shake a leg, wake the dead<br>Shake a leg, get stuck in<br>Shake a leg, shake a leg yeah<br><br>Magazines, wet dreams, dirty women on machines for me<br>Big licks, skin flicks, trickey dick's are my chemistry<br>Goin' against the grain, trying to keep me sane with you<br>So stop your grinnin' and drop your linen for me<br><br>Chorus<br><br>Idle juvenile on the street, on the street<br>Kicking everything with his feet, with his feet<br>Fighting on the wrong side of the law, of the law<br>Spitting and biten' and kicking and fightin' for more<br><br>Chorus
