			<div>Two faced woman<br />
with the two faced lies<br />
I hope your two faced living made you satisfied<br />
Tell me baby I was your only one<br />
While you�ve been running around town<br />
with every mother�s son<br />
<br />Told your story about the women like you<br />
Told your story about the things you do<br />
I used to think that you were sugar and spice<br />
I should�ve listened to my mother�s advice<br />
<br />Kicked in the teeth again<br />
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win<br />
Kicked in the teeth again<br />
Ain�t this misery ever gonna end?<br />
And I�ve been kicked in the teeth<br />
Kicked in the teeth again<br />
<br />Two faced woman, such a crying shame<br />
Don�t know nothing, you�re all the same<br />
You run around, hope you had your fun<br />
You never know who�s gonna win<br />
till the race been run<br />
<br />Kicked in the teeth again<br />
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win<br />
Kicked in the teeth again<br />
Ain�t this misery ever gonna end?<br />
And I�ve been kicked in the teeth<br />
Kicked in the teeth again</div>
