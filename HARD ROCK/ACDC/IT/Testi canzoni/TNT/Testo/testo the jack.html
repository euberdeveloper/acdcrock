			<div>She gave me the Queen
		<br> She gave me the King
		 <br> She was wheelin’ and dealin’
		 <br> Just doin’ her thing
		 <br> She was holdin’ a pair
		 <br> But I had to try
		 <br> Her Deuce was wild
		 <br> But my Ace was high
		 <br> But how was I to know
		 <br> That she’d been dealt with before
		 <br> Said she’d never had a Full House
		 <br> But I should have known
		 <br> From the tattoo on her left leg
		 <br> And the garter on her right
		 <br> She’d have the card to bring me down
		 <br> If she played it right
	 	<br>
		 <br> She’s got the Jack
		 <br> She’s got the Jack
		 <br> She’s got the Jack…
		 <br>
		 <br> Poker face was her name
		 <br> Poker face was her nature
		 <br> Poker straight was her game
		 <br> If she knew she could get you
		 <br> She play’d ‘em fast
		 <br> She play’d ‘em hard
		 <br> She could close her eyes
		 <br> And feel every card
		 <br> But how was I to know
		 <br> That she’d been shuffled before
		 <br> Said she’d never had a Royal Flush
		 <br> But I should have known
		 <br> That all the cards were comin’
		 <br> From the bottom of the pack
		 <br> And if I’d known what she was dealin’ out
		 <br> I’d have dealt it back
		 <br>
		 <br> She’s got the Jack
		 <br> She’s got the Jack
		 <br> She’s got the Jack…
