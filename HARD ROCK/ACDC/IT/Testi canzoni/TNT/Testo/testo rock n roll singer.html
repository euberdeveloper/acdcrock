			<div>My Daddy was workin’ nine to five
		 <br> When my Momma was havin’ me
		 <br> By the time I was half alive
		 <br> They knew what I was gonna be
		 <br> I left school and grew my hair
		 <br> They didn’t understand
		 <br> They wanted me to be respected as
		 <br> A doctor or a lawyer man
		 <br> (But I had other plans)
		 <br>
		 <br> Gonna be a rock ‘n’ roll singer
		 <br> Gonna be a rock ‘n’ roll star
		 <br>
		 <br> Well I worked real hard and bought myself
		 <br> A rock ‘n’ roll guitar
		 <br> I gotta be on top some day
		 <br> I wanna be a star
		 <br> I can see my name in lights
		 <br> And I can see the queue
		 <br> I got the devil in my blood
		 <br> Tellin’ me what to do
		 <br> (And I’m all ears)
		 <br>
		 <br> Gonna be a rock ‘n’ roll singer
		 <br> Gonna be a rock ‘n’ roll star
		 <br> (I hear it pays well)
		 <br>
		 <br> You can stick your nine to five livin’
		 <br> And your collar and your tie
		 <br> And stick your moral standards
		 <br> ‘Cause it’s all a dirty lie
		 <br> You can stick your golden handshake
		 <br> And you can stick your silly rules
		 <br> And all the other shit
		 <br> That they teach to kids in school
		 <br> (‘Cause I ain’t no fool)
		 <br>
		 <br> Gonna be a rock ‘n’ roll singer
		 <br> Gonna be a rock ‘n’ roll star
		 <br> Yes I are!</div>
