			<div>Breaking out, about to shout<br />
Feel the need, for one more round<br />
Don&#039;t you struggle, don&#039;t try to bite<br />
You want some trouble, I&#039;m the king of vice<br />
I&#039;m a wrecking ball, I&#039;m a stinging knife<br />
Steal your money, gonna take your life<br />
You got screaming murder, lock up your door<br />
Double dealing, gotta have more<br />
Call me dirty, trash my name<br />
Just tell the boys that I&#039;m gonna be<br />
Back in business again, back in business again<br />
Back in business again, back in business again<br />
Back in business<br />
<br />Flesh and blood, I&#039;m a rag &#039;n&#039; bone<br />
Bad luck message on the telephone<br />
Don&#039;t you worry, play my game<br />
I&#039;ll do you a favour put your soul for sale<br />
Like a cannon ball going down the track<br />
Need good loving, but I want it back<br />
I was born in trouble, they gave up on me<br />
Teacher preaching what not to be<br />
Call me dirty, trash my name<br />
Just tell the boys that I&#039;m gonna be<br />
Back in business again, back in business again<br />
Back in business again, back in business again<br />
Back in business<br />
<br />Back in business again, back in business again<br />
Back in business again, back in business again<br />
Back in business again, back in business, back in business again<br />
Back in business again, back in business, back in business again<br />
<br />Back in business again, and I&#039;m looking for you</div>
