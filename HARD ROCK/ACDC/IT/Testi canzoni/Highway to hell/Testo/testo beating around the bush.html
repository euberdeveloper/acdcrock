			<div>Smilin&#8217; face and laughin&#8217; eyes,<br />
but you keep on tellin&#8217; me<br />
all those lies<br />
How&#8217;d you expect me to believe, honey,<br />
I ain&#8217;t that naive<br />
Baby, I got my eye on you cause you do<br />
all the things I want you to<br />
Stop your cryin&#8217; and dry you tears,<br />
I ain&#8217;t that wet behind the ears<br />
You can throw me lefts,<br />
you can throw me rights,<br />
but where was you last night<br />
<br />Beating around the bush<br />
<br />Wish I knew what was on your mind,<br />
why you bein&#8217; so unkind<br />
Remember those nights we spent alone<br />
talking on the telephone<br />
Thoughts of you goin&#8217; throw my brain,<br />
you told me that you felt the same<br />
You said that you loved me too,<br />
but tell me who was there with you<br />
I was talkin&#8217; birds and<br />
you was talkin&#8217; bees and<br />
was he down upon his knees<br />
<br />Beating around the bush<br />
<br />You�re the meanest woman<br />
I�ve ever known,<br />
sticks and stones won&#8217;t break my bones<br />
I know what you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for,<br />
you&#8217;ve eaten your cake<br />
you want some more<br />
I�m gonna give you just one more chance,<br />
try to save our romance<br />
I�ve done everything, I�m gonna do,<br />
the rest is up to you<br />
And you can chew it up,<br />
you can spit it out, you can let it all hang out<br />
<br />Beating around the bush<br />
<br />Chew it up<br />
Spit it out<br />
Let it all hang out<br />
Beating around the bush</div>
