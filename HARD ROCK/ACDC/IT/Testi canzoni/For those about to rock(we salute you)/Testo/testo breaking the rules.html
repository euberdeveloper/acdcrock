			</h1>

		<h3>
			<div>Black sheep and a renegade<br />
Hot feet in the cool of the shade<br />
Street shuffle and a tough childhoods<br />
Examinations done no good<br />
Crow bars and a hot wired cars<br />
Sneak thieves and cheap cigars<br />
No rebellion, not today<br />
I get my kicks in my own way<br />
Right, OK<br />
<br />
Just keep on breaking the rules<br />
Come on, get ready to rule<br />
<br />
Tough breaks in the neighbourhood<br />
A hard case who's up to no good<br />
Living like trash, a society rash<br />
Ready to break, and ready to dash<br />
A bad deal and a real rough ride<br />
You're doing time on the other side<br />
No rebellion, not today<br />
I get my kicks in my own way<br />
Right, OK<br />
<br />
Just keep on breaking the rules<br />
Come on, get ready to rule<br />
<br />
(Tough breaks)<br />
<br />
They got regulation ties<br />
Regulation shoes<br />
Those regulation fools<br />
With their regulation rules<br />
<br />
Just keep on breaking the rules
