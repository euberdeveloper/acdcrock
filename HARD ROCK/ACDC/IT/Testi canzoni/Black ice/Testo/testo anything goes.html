			 Got a taste of a rocking band,
<br>Standing there holding out your hand,
<br>Better lock up all your doors,
<br>She's like a spinning dynamo,
<br>You're handing out the token prize,
<br>Giving you a brand new ride,
<br>
<br>Ooh there she goes, she goes,
<br>And nobody knows where she goes,
<br>
<br>Banging drums, working out all fast,
<br>Heavy tune I can play it loud,
<br>You know she's blowing away all the others,
<br>You're never man enough take it on all night,
<br>You better razzle dazzle on that stage,
<br>Keep on rocking all through the night,
<br>
<br>Ooh there she goes, she goes,
<br>And nobody knows,
<br>Where she goes she goes,
<br>
<br>A heavy rocking tune is playing,
<br>Playing as the night rolls on,
<br>Sneaking off with the Romeo,
<br>Where she goes, nobody knows
<br>
<br>(Guitar Solo)
<br>
<br>A heavy rocking tune is playing on a flat screen colour TV,
<br>Sneaking over creepy crawly, never give it up to take it out through the night,
<br>
<br>There she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
<br>There she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
<br>Where she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
<br>Where she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
<br>Where she goes she goes
