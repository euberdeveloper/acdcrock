			<div>Ruby, Ruby, where you been so long<br />
Done took to drinkin� whiskey<br />
Baby since you been gone<br />
Ain�t no one I know do it as good as you<br />
Lickin� on that lickin� stick the way you do<br />
You got the lips to make a strong man weak<br />
And a heathen pray<br />
Tell you ain�t just the way you speak<br />
<br />You know it�s just the way you go down<br />
Go down, go down, go down, go down<br />
Go down, go down, go down, go down<br />
<br />Mary, Mary, you�re the one for me<br />
And the way you hum<br />
Sting like a bumble bee<br />
I�ll be around to see you �bout half past ten<br />
Ain�t felt this good<br />
Since I don�t know when<br />
You got the touch that I need so much<br />
In your finger tips<br />
I got the honey that ya love to taste<br />
On those lovely lips so go down<br />
Go down, go down, go down, go down<br />
Go down, go down, go down, go down<br />
<br />Baby rub it on<br />
Y� know it�s sticky and sweet<br />
And it�s been so long<br />
And no else got a touch like you<br />
I let you do the things to me<br />
I let no other woman do<br />
Feels good, feels good,<br />
You do it like you should<br />
<br />I loved you so much<br />
Make me so glad I�m a man<br />
Go down, go down, go down, go down<br />
Go down, go down, go down, go down</div>
